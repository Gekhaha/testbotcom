        <!-- First Phase -->
        <div class="roadmap-box">
            <h2>Phase 1: Initial Development and Prototyping</h2>
            <p>
                The first phase focuses on laying the foundation of the project. This includes brainstorming the concept, creating the initial design, and setting up basic infrastructure. We will also begin prototyping the core features and test them for functionality. During this phase, we focus on:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Defining project goals and objectives</li>
                <li>Initial design and planning</li>
                <li>Creating a basic prototype</li>
                <li>Testing core features for feasibility</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Second Phase -->
        <div class="roadmap-box">
            <h2>Phase 2: Development and Refinement</h2>
            <p>
                In the second phase, the project moves into active development. This is where features and functionalities are implemented, and the product begins to take shape. The primary goal is to refine the initial prototype by adding enhancements, improving performance, and addressing any technical issues. Key activities during this phase include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building out core features and functionality</li>
                <li>Refining design and UI/UX</li>
                <li>Optimizing performance and fixing bugs</li>
                <li>Collecting feedback and iterating on design</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Third Phase -->
        <div class="roadmap-box">
            <h2>Phase 3: Final Testing and Launch</h2>
            <p>
                The final phase focuses on testing the product thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected. After all bugs are fixed, the product is polished, and itâ€™s ready for launch. Key activities in this phase include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Final round of testing (unit tests, user tests, etc.)</li>
                <li>Addressing any last-minute issues</li>
                <li>Polishing design and UI</li>
                <li>Preparing for launch and marketing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After the product launch, we will monitor feedback, make necessary improvements, and ensure the long-term success of the project.
